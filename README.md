# ALL NBA TEAMS PROJECT

### This is my Ironhack Data Analytics mid-bootcamp project, a project about Cleaning, Transforming and Exploring the data.


Inside the `Notebooks` folder you will find three Jupyter Notebooks, where is the work I have done using Pyhton.

In the first notebook I perform the following tasks:
* Load datasets from the `all_nba_teams.xlsx` and `player_data` files.
* Data cleaning and formatting.
* Save cleaned data in SQL and also as csv.


In the second notebook I perform the following tasks:
* Read cleaned data back from SQL.
* Test Hypothesis.
* Transform data, push it to SQL and save it as csv.

Finally, in the third notebook I perform the Exploratory Data Analysis.
